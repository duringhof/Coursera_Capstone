Based on the distribution of charge points in Norway, their distances to eachother and to other services (like restaurants and shopping), all compared to the current situation in Sweden; a recommendation is sought on where to start installing new charge points.\n\n### Data needed\nAt the heart of the solution will be the foursquare location category \"EV Charging Station\", together with distances to other venues that could be of intererst to EV owners charging their car (restaurants, shopping, playgrounds etc...). This data will be analysed for at least the capitals Stockholm and Oslo, and potentially the whole countries.",
